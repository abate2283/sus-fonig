Greetings to the Thessalonians
(1 Thessalonians 1:1-10; Philemon 1:1-3)
1Paul and Silvanusa and Timothy,

To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

2Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3We ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers, just as it is fitting, because your faith is increasing exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all to one another is abounding, 4so as for us ourselves to boast in you in the churches of God about your endurance and faith in all your persecutions, and in the tribulations that you are bearing.

Christ's Coming
5This is a plain token of the righteous judgment of God, for you to be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer. 6For indeed it is righteous with God to repay those oppressing you with affliction, 7and to you being oppressed, repose with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with His mighty angels, 8in a fire of flame, inflicting vengeance on those not knowing God and on those not obeying the gospel of our Lord Jesus, 9who will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, 10when in that day He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be marveled at among all those having believed because our testimony to you was believed, 11for which also we pray always for you, that He may count you worthy of the calling of our God, and He may fulfill every good pleasure of goodness and work of faith with power, 12so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
